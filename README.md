# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis
 We will be using Natural Language Processing or it's called NLP in short. to analyse emotions and sentiments of given text.
 In this project we will be able to:
 
 1) analyse different emotions present in a tweet like sadness, happiness, jealousy etc
2) You will be able to find out the dominant emotion in the text
3) You will be able to plot those emotions on a graph
4) And you will also be able to tell whether the whole text is a positive or negative emotion
5) And finally you will also be able scrap tweets with a hashtag and find out the public opinion on that hashtag. For example you can search for #donaldtrump and find out whether that emotion is associated with a positive or a negative sentiment.
